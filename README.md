# Karaoke Assistant

This projects aims to give a guide to turn a K12 Karaoke Speaker from AliExpress into a fully functional voice assistant using ESPHome and Home Assistant.

## BOM

This is going to be an extremely short list as I tried to use readily available modules that should fit like a glove into the PCB.

  - _Choose the 1 mic version as you won't need it at all_
- ESP32-S3 Development Board N16R8 ([Link to AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006266375800.html))
